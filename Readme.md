#XMLConfJoiner.

Used to join _user_ and _server_ parts of abstract *MuliChannel Server* XML-based modules configurations into single one.

There are many propieritary implementations of such servers with different names but similar configuration structure.
One may apply root server name as additional `-servername` parameter while running this tool. Default is `MULTICHANNELSERVER`.
